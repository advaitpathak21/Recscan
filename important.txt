**INSTALLING GO IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. IF GO IS ALREADY INSTALLED, GO TO STEP 4 directly** 
1) Install go for Linux using: https://golang.org/dl/ and then use tar as specified on the page.
2) After this, we need to make changes to the profile to add the environment variable for GO
3) Add the environment variable to profile using : gedit ~/.profile. Append (export GOPATH=$HOME/go export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin) to the profile file and do . ~/.profile on the terminal
4) Now, run depends.py : python depends.py
5) Now, you are ready to run recscan
